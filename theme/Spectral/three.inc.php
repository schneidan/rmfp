									<h3>Andrew MacGregor</h3>

									<p>There's a bit of time to run off and adventure. There's the sky above, and road below your feet. There's the promise of something new and beautiful around every corner and up every winding mountain pass. There's the joy of tall trees, the crunch of gravel, the smell of dust and oncoming rain in the summer. The sigh of the wind in high lonesome places. Steel rails leading off to the distance, going on across the country, leading and calling you to follow.</p>

									<h3>Craig Pindell</h3>
									<img src="<?php get_theme_url(); ?>/images/craig-mug-pl.jpg" class="image right" />
									<p>Photographing Anasazi ruins and artwork has been Craig's main focus the past several years. He still enjoys photographing landscape and nature's abstractions, but the Anasazi comes first. Since the horrible events of September 11, 2001, Craig has marked the anniversary of the tragedy by creating a photograph at the exact time the first plane hit the World Trade Center. This ongoing project assure the day will be marked and remembered, at least by one person.</p>

									<h3>Daniel J. Schneider</h3>
									<img src="<?php get_theme_url(); ?>/images/daniel-mug-pl.jpg" class="image right" />
									<p>Daniel seeks to tell the story of the West as he sees it through photographs. By sharing his unique perspective, he hopes to share through his journeys the history that brought prosperity to Colorado and surrounding states blah blah blah. He works exclusively with film, preferring a medium that is born and developed in physical form from beginning to end. I also like wearing a hat because it keeps the sun from burning my neck when I'm making pictures.</p>
