&lt;h2&gt;PROJECTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members each have their own directions and priorities, but share a love of both the beautiful country and the unique history of the rural and wild lands in the Rocky Mountain region. In early 2015 their first collaborative project, examining the region&#039;s pioneering past through the current state of the land and its buildings and inhabitants, began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MEMBERSHIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Membership is informal and primarily on the basis of friendship and shared vision. Please inquire through the comunication channels listed lower on this page if you have and interest in working with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
